# ML-from-scratch
Implementing ML algorithms from scratch in Python using numpy arrays and matplotlib for visualization without the use of sophisticated machine learning libraries.

Simulated sampling distribution.  
Executed the gradient descent algorithm.  
Performed Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and the Expectation Maximization Algorithm.

A basic project mainly for understanding the math and working of machine learning models in depth.

The report is named 'Bayesian_methods_of_ML.pdf'.
