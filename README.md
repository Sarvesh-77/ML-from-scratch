# ML-from-scratch
Implementing ML algorithms from scratch in Python using numpy arrays and matplotlib for visualization without the use of sophisticated machine learning libraries.

Simulated sampling distribution  
Implemented gradient descent algorithm  
Performed Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Expectation Maximization algorithm.

A basic project mainly for understanding the math and working of machine learning models in depth.
